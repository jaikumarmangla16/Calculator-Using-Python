# 🧮 Simple Calculator in Python

This is a basic **command-line calculator** built using Python. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 🚀 Features
- Takes two integer inputs from the user.
- Supports four operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Handles invalid inputs and division by zero with appropriate error messages.
- Uses Python's modern `match-case` (pattern matching) syntax for operation handling.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the Python file in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
Follow the prompts:

Enter two numbers.

Choose an operation symbol (+, -, *, /).
